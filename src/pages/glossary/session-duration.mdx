Session duration is the total amount of time a user spends actively engaging with a website during a single visit. It begins when a user first lands on any page and ends when they either close the browser, navigate away from the site, or remain inactive for a set period (typically 30 minutes).

## How Session Duration is Calculated

Session duration is calculated by measuring the time between a user's first and last interaction within a given session. These interactions can include:
- Page views
- Click events
- Form submissions
- Video plays
- Scroll depth
- Custom events

## Why Session Duration Matters

Session duration is a vital metric for several reasons:

- **User Engagement**: Longer sessions often indicate more engaged users who find value in your content
- **Content Quality**: It helps evaluate how compelling your content is to visitors
- **Website Performance**: Can highlight technical issues that might be causing users to leave quickly
- **Conversion Potential**: Generally, longer sessions correlate with higher conversion rates
