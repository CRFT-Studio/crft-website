A user flow is a visual representation or documentation of the complete path a user takes through a website or application, from entry point to final action. It maps out the series of steps and decisions users make while interacting with a digital product to accomplish their objectives.

## Key Components of User Flows

### Entry Points
User flows begin with entry points - the various ways users might arrive at your website or application. These could include:
- Direct URL entry
- Search engine results
- Social media links
- Email marketing campaigns
- Paid advertisements

### Steps and Actions
The middle portion of a user flow consists of the various interactions and decisions users make, such as:
- Clicking navigation elements
- Filling out forms
- Making selections
- Scrolling through content
- Engaging with interactive elements

### Exit Points
The flow concludes with an exit point - typically the successful completion of a task such as:
- Making a purchase
- Signing up for a newsletter
- Downloading a resource
- Submitting a contact form

## Benefits of User Flow Analysis
