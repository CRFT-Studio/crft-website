Time on Page is a fundamental web analytics metric that calculates the amount of time a user spends actively viewing and engaging with a specific webpage, from the moment they land on it until they navigate to another page or exit the site.

## Understanding Time on Page

Time on Page provides valuable insights into user engagement and content effectiveness. A longer time spent on a page often indicates that users find the content valuable, relevant, or engaging. However, context is crucial â€“ while a long duration might be positive for blog posts or detailed product pages, it could signal confusion or poor user experience on checkout or contact pages.

## How Time on Page is Calculated

The calculation of Time on Page involves tracking:
- The timestamp when a user enters a page
- The timestamp when they navigate to another page
- The difference between these two timestamps

It's important to note that the final page in a session cannot have an accurate Time on Page measurement since there's no subsequent pageview to mark the end time.
