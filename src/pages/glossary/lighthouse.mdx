A Lighthouse Score is a comprehensive performance metric generated by Google's open-source tool, Lighthouse, which analyzes web pages and provides scores across multiple categories to help developers improve their websites' quality.

## Key Performance Categories

Lighthouse evaluates websites across four main categories, each scored from 0 to 100:

1. **Performance**: Measures loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability
2. **Accessibility**: Evaluates how well the site works for users with disabilities
3. **Best Practices**: Checks adherence to modern web development standards
4. **SEO**: Assesses search engine optimization fundamentals

## How to Access Lighthouse

The most common ways to access Lighthouse include:

- Using [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), which provides both mobile and desktop analysis
- Through Chrome DevTools (F12 > Lighthouse tab)
- Via command-line interface (CLI)
- As a Node module for automated testing
