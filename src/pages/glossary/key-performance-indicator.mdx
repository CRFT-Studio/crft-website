A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a quantifiable measurement used to evaluate the success of an organization, project, or individual in meeting specific objectives over time.

## Choosing the Right KPIs

Selecting appropriate KPIs is crucial for meaningful performance measurement. At CRFT Studio, we carefully select KPIs that align with each client's unique goals and business objectives.

### Alignment with Goals
KPIs should directly relate to your business objectives. For an e-commerce site, conversion rates and average order value might be priority metrics, while a content-focused site might prioritize engagement metrics like time on page and return visitors.

### Measurability
Effective KPIs must be quantifiable and consistently measurable over time. This requires proper tracking tools and analytics implementation.

### Actionability
The best KPIs provide insights that can lead to specific improvements. For example, tracking page load times can identify opportunities for optimization.
