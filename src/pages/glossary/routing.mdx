Routing is a fundamental concept in web development that determines how an application handles different URL requests and directs users to the appropriate content. It acts as a traffic controller, interpreting URL paths and parameters to decide what content should be displayed on the screen.

## Core Routing Concepts

### URL Structure
A typical [URL](/glossary/url) consists of several components:
- Protocol (https://)
- Domain (example.com)
- Path (/blog/posts)
- Parameters (?id=123)
- Fragments (#section)

### Types of Routes

#### Static Routes
Fixed paths that always lead to the same content, like:
- /about
- /contact
- /services

#### Dynamic Routes
URLs that include variables or parameters:
- /products/:id
- /blog/:year/:month/:slug
- /users/:username

## Routing Methods

### Server-Side Routing
- Traditional method where each URL request triggers a server response
- Full page reloads occur with each navigation
- Better for initial SEO but slower user experience

### Client-Side Routing
- Modern approach used in Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Handles navigation without full page reloads
- Smoother user experience but requires additional setup for SEO

## Astro's Routing System

### File-Based Routing
Astro implements an intuitive file-based routing system where the file structure in your project directly maps to your website's URLs:

src/pages/
├── index.astro → /
├── about.astro → /about
└── blog/
├── index.astro → /blog
└── post-1.astro → /blog/post-1


### Dynamic Routes
Astro supports dynamic routing through special filename patterns:
- `[slug].astro` creates dynamic routes
- `[...slug].astro` enables catch-all routes
- Parameters can be accessed via `Astro.params`

### Route Customization
Astro allows for:
- Custom 404 pages
- Redirects
- API routes
- SSR and static output options

## Best Practices

### URL Design
- Use clear, descriptive paths
- Keep URLs human-readable
- Maintain consistent patterns
- Consider SEO implications

### Performance
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider code splitting
- Use preloading for critical routes

### Security
- Validate [URL parameters](/glossary/query-string)
- Implement proper access controls
- Handle edge cases and errors

Understanding routing is essential for creating well-structured web applications that provide intuitive navigation and optimal user experience. Whether using traditional server-side routing or modern client-side approaches, proper route management ensures your application remains maintainable and scalable.
