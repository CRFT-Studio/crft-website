shortDefinition: "A threshold that controls how many requests a user or client can make to a server within a specified time period."

Rate limiting is a crucial security and resource management technique that restricts the number of times a user, IP address, or client can access an API or website within a designated timeframe. This mechanism helps prevent abuse, maintain service stability, and ensure fair resource distribution among users.

## Why Rate Limiting Matters

Rate limiting serves multiple essential purposes in web development and API management:

- **Server Protection**: Prevents server overload from excessive requests
- **Security Enhancement**: Helps mitigate DDoS attacks and brute force attempts
- **Resource Management**: Ensures fair distribution of server resources
- **Cost Control**: Manages API usage costs and bandwidth consumption
- **Service Quality**: Maintains consistent performance for all users

## Common Rate Limiting Strategies

### Fixed Window
The simplest form of rate limiting, where requests are counted within fixed time intervals (e.g., 100 requests per hour, starting at the top of each hour).

### Sliding Window
A more refined approach that considers a rolling time period, providing smoother request distribution and preventing request spikes at interval boundaries.

### Token Bucket
Uses a token-based system where tokens are gradually replenished over time, allowing for burst traffic while maintaining overall limits.

## Implementation Best Practices

### Response Headers
Standard rate limit headers should be included in API responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time until the limit resets

### Status Codes
When a rate limit is exceeded, servers should respond with:
- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Clear error message
- Retry-After header suggesting when to retry

## Handling Rate Limits

Developers should implement proper error handling for rate-limited requests:

1. Implement exponential backoff
2. Queue requests when approaching limits
3. Use multiple API keys or endpoints when available
4. Cache responses to reduce request frequency
5. Monitor usage patterns to optimize request timing

Rate limiting is an integral part of modern web architecture, working alongside other security measures like [Authentication](/glossary/authentication) and [API Keys](/glossary/api) to create robust and reliable web services.
