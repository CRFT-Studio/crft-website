Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web security vulnerability that enables attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can bypass security measures because they appear to originate from trusted sources, potentially compromising user data, session tokens, or other sensitive information.

## Types of XSS Attacks

### Reflected XSS
Reflected XSS occurs when malicious scripts are immediately reflected off a web server through error messages, search results, or any other response that includes user-submitted data. The attack is typically delivered through specially crafted links that victims must click on.

### Stored XSS
Also known as persistent XSS, this type occurs when the malicious script is permanently stored on target servers in databases, message forums, visitor logs, or comment fields. Every user viewing the affected page becomes a potential victim.

### DOM-based XSS
This variant occurs when the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code. The attack payload is executed through the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, never reaching the server.

## Common Attack Vectors

### Input Fields
Form fields, search boxes, and comment sections are prime targets for XSS attacks. Without proper sanitization, these inputs can become gateways for malicious code injection.

### URL Parameters
Attackers often manipulate URL parameters to inject malicious scripts, especially in applications that reflect these parameters in the page content.

### HTTP Headers
Some applications display data from HTTP headers on their pages, which can be exploited if not properly sanitized.

## Prevention Techniques

### Input Validation
Implementing strict input validation on both client and server sides helps prevent malicious scripts from entering the application. This includes:
- Validating data types
- Checking length limits
- Allowing only specific characters

### Output Encoding
Converting special characters to their HTML entity equivalents ensures that browsers interpret the content as data rather than executable code. Common encoding methods include:
- HTML encoding
- JavaScript encoding
- URL encoding

### Security Headers
Implementing security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) provides an additional layer of protection against XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded and executed.

## Impact on Web Development

Understanding XSS is crucial for modern web development, as these vulnerabilities can lead to:
- Stolen user credentials
- Hijacked user sessions
- Defaced websites
- Malware distribution
- Compromised user privacy

Developers must maintain a security-first mindset and implement proper safeguards to protect their applications and users from these common but dangerous attacks.
