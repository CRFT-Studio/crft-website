shortDefinition: "A URL or URI where an API can be accessed to perform specific actions or retrieve data from a service or system."

An endpoint is a specific URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that serves as a point of communication between different software systems, typically in the context of [APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)](/glossary/api). It represents the location where resources can be accessed and where the API can receive requests to perform specific actions.

## Understanding API Endpoints

Endpoints are fundamental components of modern web architecture, acting as the digital doorways through which different applications and services communicate. They follow a structured format that typically includes:

- Base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`)
- Resource path (e.g., `/users`)
- Optional parameters (e.g., `/users?id=123`)

## Common Types of Endpoints

### RESTful Endpoints
REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs organize endpoints around resources and HTTP methods:
- GET `/users` - Retrieve users
- POST `/users` - Create a new user
- PUT `/users/{id}` - Update a user
- DELETE `/users/{id}` - Remove a user

### GraphQL Endpoints
Unlike REST, GraphQL typically uses a single endpoint (e.g., `/graphql`) that accepts different queries and mutations to interact with data.

## Best Practices for Endpoint Design

### Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Follow consistent patterns
- Use nouns for resources
- Keep URLs lowercase
- Use hyphens for word separation

### Security Considerations
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS encryption
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation
- Error handling

## Role in Modern Web Development

Endpoints are crucial in:
- Microservices architecture
- Mobile app development
- Third-party integrations
- Serverless functions
- Web APIs

Understanding endpoints is essential for modern web development as they form the foundation of how different systems interact and exchange data in our interconnected digital world.
