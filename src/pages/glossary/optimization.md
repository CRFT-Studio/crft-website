### User Experience (UX) Optimization
UX optimization aims to enhance how users interact with and experience a website:
- Intuitive navigation design
- Clear call-to-action placement
- Responsive layouts
- Accessible design implementation
- Load time improvement

## Benefits of Website Optimization

### Improved User Engagement
