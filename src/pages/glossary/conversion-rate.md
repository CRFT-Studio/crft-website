Conversion rate is a key performance metric that measures the percentage of website visitors who complete a desired action or goal. It's calculated by dividing the number of conversions by the total number of visitors and multiplying by 100. For example, if 100 people visit your website and 5 make a purchase, your conversion rate is 5%.

## Why Conversion Rates Matter

Conversion rates are fundamental indicators of a website's effectiveness and ROI. They help businesses understand how well their website design, content, and user experience contribute to achieving business objectives. A high conversion rate typically suggests that your website successfully persuades visitors to take action, while a low rate might indicate areas needing improvement.
