Anchor scroll, also known as smooth scrolling or anchor link scrolling, is a [navigation](/glossary/navigation) method that automatically moves the [viewport](/glossary/viewport) to a specific section of a webpage when a user clicks on a corresponding link. This creates a smooth, animated transition instead of an abrupt jump to the target location.

## How Anchor Scrolling Works

Anchor scrolling relies on two main components: HTML anchor links and CSS scroll behavior. The HTML element uses an ID attribute that corresponds to a link's href attribute with a hashtag (#). When implemented with CSS's scroll-behavior property set to "smooth," the browser creates an animated scroll effect between the current position and the target element.

## Implementation Methods

### Basic HTML Setup
```html
<nav>
  <a href="#section1">Section 1</a>
  <a href="#section2">Section 2</a>
</nav>

<section id="section1">Content</section>
<section id="section2">Content</section>
```

### CSS Implementation
```css
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

## Benefits of Anchor Scrolling

### Enhanced User Experience
- Provides visual feedback during navigation
- Creates a more polished, professional feel
- Helps users maintain context while moving through content

### Improved Navigation
- Makes long-form content more accessible
- Reduces disorientation from sudden page jumps
- Supports better content hierarchy understanding

## Best Practices

### Performance Considerations
- Keep animation duration reasonable (300-800ms)
- Consider users who prefer reduced motion
- Test scroll behavior across different devices and browsers

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Provide visible focus states
- Include skip navigation options for screen readers

## Modern Implementations

Contemporary websites often enhance anchor scrolling with JavaScript libraries or frameworks for additional features like:
- Custom animation timing
- Scroll offset adjustments
- Mobile-specific behaviors
- Progress indicators
- Scroll-spy functionality

Understanding and implementing anchor scroll effectively can significantly improve your website's navigation experience, making it an essential tool in modern web design.
