A dark pattern is a user interface design choice that manipulates users into doing something they didn't intend to do, often by exploiting human psychology and cognitive biases. These designs prioritize business interests over user experience and ethical considerations.

## Common Types of Dark Patterns

### Bait and Switch
When users are led to expect one outcome but get another. For example, a "close" button that actually leads to another page or subscription form.

### Forced Continuity
When a free trial automatically converts to a paid subscription without clear warning, often making cancellation deliberately difficult.

### Hidden Costs
Additional fees, charges, or subscriptions that are only revealed at the final stages of checkout, after users have invested time in the process.

### Misdirection
Using visual hierarchy, color, or contrast to highlight preferred options while making unwanted (but user-beneficial) options less noticeable.

### Confirmshaming
Guilt-tripping users who decline an offer through manipulative copy, like "No thanks, I don't want to save money" as the decline option.

## Impact on User Experience

Dark patterns significantly damage user trust and can lead to:
- Increased bounce rates
- Lower conversion rates
- Negative brand perception
- Poor customer loyalty
- Legal consequences in some jurisdictions

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Many countries are implementing laws against deceptive design practices. The EU's GDPR and California's CCPA have provisions that effectively restrict certain dark patterns, particularly regarding data collection and privacy choices.

## Best Practices for Ethical Design

### Transparency
- Clearly communicate all costs, terms, and conditions
- Make important information easily accessible
- Use plain language without manipulation

### User Control
- Provide straightforward opt-out options
- Make cancellation processes simple
- Allow users to easily undo actions

### Clear Communication
- Use honest, straightforward messaging
- Avoid manipulative language
- Present choices equally without bias

## Detection and Prevention

Designers and developers can prevent dark patterns by:
- Conducting ethical design reviews
- Implementing user testing to identify unintended manipulation
- Creating design guidelines that prioritize user welfare
- Regular audits of user interfaces and user journeys
