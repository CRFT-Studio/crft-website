An effective website is the backbone of every winning brand. But even the most beautiful sites can underperform if their design fundamentals aren't rock solid. Regular audits ensure you're not leaving money—or credibility—on the table. This guide walks you through exactly how to audit your website’s design, highlights where the [CRFT Lookup](/lookup) shines for actionable insights, and—if you want an expert boost—shows you how to request your [free hero section redesign](/audit) from CRFT Studio.

## Why a Design Audit is a Secret Weapon for Growth

Most founders and marketers know about SEO audits. Fewer realize that **design audits**—when done right—deliver outsized returns:

- They surface hidden friction costing you conversions.
- They reveal branding misfires before they erode trust.
- They give you a fresh lens on your business (and what visitors actually see).
- They let you benchmark against competitors or industry leaders.

The clients I've worked with thus far at CRFT Studio all conduct design reviews religiously. Here’s what a thorough process typically looks like.

## Step 1: Review Your Hero Section (and Supercharge It for Free!)

Your homepage hero is your digital first impression. Start here:

- Is the value prop **immediate** and crystal-clear?
- Does the headline communicate a benefit—not just features?
- Is the primary call-to-action (CTA) obvious and visually prominent?
- Is the design visually engaging, but free of clutter?

If you answer "no" to any of these—or just want outside perspective—[submit your site for a complimentary hero redesign](/audit). We’ll review your hero section and send you back a high-impact redesign, completely free.

**Pro move:** Use the [CRFT Lookup](/lookup) to check your site’s core tech stack and make sure nothing’s interfering with above-the-fold performance.

## Step 2: Assess Navigation and Site Structure

Efficient, intuitive navigation is fundamental:

- Is the menu uncluttered, with only your essential pages?
- Can a new visitor find "Contact," "About," and "Services" in under three clicks?
- Does your menu perform well on mobile and desktop?

## Step 3: Branding Consistency—A Visual Deep-Dive

Brand recall suffers when colors, fonts, and styles are inconsistent:

- Compare headings, body text, and button styles throughout your site.
- Review color usage for both accessibility and on-brand impact.
- Check logos and imagery for crispness and positioning.
- For inspiration, browse website aggregators like [Godly](https://godly.website) or [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/).

## Step 4: Readability, Accessibility, and User Comfort

Great design serves the user above all:

- Is your main content easy to read (think: font size, contrast, spacing)?
- Are buttons and forms sufficiently large and spaced, especially for mobile?
- Are alt tags and semantic HTML used properly for [accessibility](/glossary/accessibility)?

Accessibility browser plugins are invaluable, but the [CRFT Lookup](/lookup) can help you surface key markup details via the [Lighthouse](/glossary/lighthouse) report if you’re looking for a second opinion.

## Step 5: Imagery, Multimedia, and Performance

Heavy or poorly-optimized media drags down performance:

- Are images compressed, optimized for Retina, and loaded responsibly?
- Are videos and large backgrounds [lazy-loaded](/glossary/lazy-loading)?
- If speed or asset bloat is a concern, a Lighthouse performance test will flag them as such. Make sure your images are in the [correct formats](/glossary/image-optimization), that you're [caching](/glossary/cache) them via a [CDN](/glossary/cdn), and code efficiency.

## Step 6: Credibility Checks—Trust Signals and Social Proof

- Are client logos, testimonials, and partner mentions easily visible and authentic?
- Is your footer current, with correct contact info?
- If you’re unsure whether crucial trust signals like SSL or security badges are present, a single scan with CRFT Lookup answers it.

## Step 7: Speed, SEO, and Technical Foundations

Even the best visual design falls flat if the site is slow or unsearchable:

- Test your homepage using the [CRFT Lookup](/lookup) for Lighthouse performance benchmarks.
- You'll also get an overview of your stack to spot bloatware.
- Confirm each page has unique meta titles, descriptions, and logical URL structures using the sitemap visualization.

## What to Do With Your Findings—Immediate Next Steps
