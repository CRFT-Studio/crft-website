// show you and bro pfps side-by-side above the h1, in the same style as Pietro and Nihal. Headline can have "two bros" in it.

// idea: write multi paragraph thing about how you got into development, but cowrite it with bro to get his side of the story.
// Then, highlight the areas you each write in a similar way to Google Docs version histor, and sign both your names at the bottom.

// talk about values regarding how you work. 1) design in code: no drawing sites in figma for long - move to code asap.
// 2) simple converts best: we don't scrolljack or build crazy animations. 3) craftsmanship: get good enough at a thing and become a craftsman.
// we make daily progress on websites towards that end.

                    <p>Pictured above is my brother, David on the right, and myself, Jeremy, through the mirror on the left. We were working on putting his new server together.
                    As you can see, we work great together.</p>
                    <p>I'm the founder and designer at CRFT (pronounced "craft"), and a developer alongside my brother. Our goal has no fluff; make the most beautiful,
                    performant and maintainable websites for the best marketing teams. The name CRFT is aspirationalâ€”the higher the quality of our work,
                    the more deserving we feel calling ourselves craftsmen.</p>
                    <p>My first experience with web design was many years ago in high school, when
                    I made my attempt at running an ecommerce store. It failed, but shortly thereafter I came to realize I enjoyed designing websites,
                    and later developing them with increasingly powerful tools. Big thanks to my developer brother, David's influence.</p>
                    <p>CRFT is mostly a team of one, but occasionally two, with David jumping in with additional development support as-needed.
                    We're both based out of <span class="bg-neutral-800 border border-neutral-700 rounded-md py-0 px-2">ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Toronto, Canada</span>.</p>
